# Week5 Challenge: Implement Continuous Monitoring, Alerting, and Logging on Kubernetes 🚀

## Objective

In this project, you'll work with popular open-source monitoring and alerting tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack. Your goal is to set up an end-to-end monitoring and alerting system for your infrastructure.

## Key Guidelines

### Leverage Open-Source Tools

Utilize Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for visualization, and the ELK stack for log management and analysis.

### Custom Monitoring Dashboard

Create a custom monitoring dashboard that provides insights into key system performance metrics. Include visualizations for CPU usage, memory consumption, disk space, and error code occurrences.

### Alerting Configuration

Implement at least two metrics-based alerts to notify you of critical system performance issues proactively. Optionally, set up two log-based alerts to detect and respond to specific events in your logs.

### Log Streaming to ELK

Stream your logs to the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) to enable efficient log analysis and visualization. Ensure that log data is readily available for troubleshooting and auditing.


## Deliverables 📦

In this challenge, you are expected to produce the following deliverables:

### 1. Architecture Diagram 🏗️
A comprehensive architecture diagram illustrates how the various cloud services and components fit together. You can use tools like draw.io, Lucidchart, or any other diagramming tool of your choice to create the diagram. 📊

### 2. Blog and GitHub Readme 📄
You should document your progress and steps taken during the challenge. This documentation could be in the form of a blog post and reference your public GitHub repo. Include code snippets, configuration files, and explanations for each step. Share your insights and learning experiences. 📝

**Here's a suggested outline for your documentation:**

- **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the challenge and its objectives. 📋
- **Step-by-Step Guide**: Provide a detailed completed task walkthrough. Include code examples and configurations where applicable. 💡
- **Challenges Faced**: Discuss any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. 🤔
- **Key Takeaways**: Share your key learnings from this week's challenge. 🧐
- **Resources**: List any helpful resources or references you used. 📚

### 3. Screen Recording or Live Website 📽️
Optionally, you can create a screen recording or deploy a live website demonstrating your implementation. This adds an interactive element to your documentation and can be valuable to your portfolio. 🎥
