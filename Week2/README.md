# Week2 Challenge: Design a 3-Tier Architecture 🚀

For this task, your objective is to design a 3-tier architecture in a cloud platform, such as AWS, Azure, or GCP, with a focus on the following key considerations:

1. **High Availability**: Ensure your architecture is highly available, capable of withstanding failures, and can provide uninterrupted service.

2. **Scalability**: Design your architecture to be highly scalable, allowing for easy and efficient resource scaling as your application's demands increase.

3. **Fault Tolerance**: Implement fault-tolerant mechanisms to minimize downtime and service interruptions during failures.

4. **Custom VPC/VNET**: Consider using a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for AWS or GCP, a Virtual Network (VNET) for Azure, or a similar network customization instead of relying on the default configurations.

5. **Security**: Prioritize security by adhering to best practices for Identity and Access Management (IAM) and implementing robust security measures.

Your design should address these considerations, resulting in a well-structured, efficient, and secure 3-tier architecture.
Feel free to leverage the capabilities of your chosen cloud platform to implement this architecture effectively.


## Deliverables 📦

In this challenge, you are expected to produce the following deliverables:

### 1. Architecture Diagram 🏗️
A comprehensive architecture diagram illustrates how the various cloud services and components fit together. You can use tools like draw.io, Lucidchart, or any other diagramming tool of your choice to create the diagram. 📊

### 2. Blog or GitHub Readme 📄
You should document your progress and steps taken during the challenge. This documentation could be in the form of a blog post or a GitHub Readme file. Include code snippets, configuration files, and explanations for each step. Share your insights and learning experiences. 📝

**Here's a suggested outline for your documentation:**

- **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the challenge and its objectives. 📋
- **Step-by-Step Guide**: Provide a detailed completed task walkthrough. Include code examples and configurations where applicable. 💡
- **Challenges Faced**: Discuss any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. 🤔
- **Key Takeaways**: Share your key learnings from this week's challenge. 🧐
- **Resources**: List any helpful resources or references you used. 📚

### 3. Screen Recording or Live Website 📽️
Optionally, you can create a screen recording or deploy a live website demonstrating your implementation. This adds an interactive element to your documentation and can be valuable to your portfolio. 🎥
