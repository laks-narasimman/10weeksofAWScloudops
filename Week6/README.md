#Week Challenge: Configuration as a Code using Ansible and MongoDB 🚀

## Objective

In this project task, you will demonstrate your proficiency with Ansible in setting up and configuring infrastructure as well as deploying a production-ready MongoDB cluster. The task involves creating Ansible playbooks, roles, and integrating them into a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CICD) pipeline. Additionally, a focus on security and best practices is essential.

## Key Guidelines

### Nginx and Application Deployment with Ansible Playbooks

Write Ansible playbooks to install Nginx and host an application on multiple servers. The playbooks should automate the deployment of your chosen application, ensuring consistency and reliability.

### Provision a Production-Ready MongoDB Cluster with Ansible Roles

Create Ansible roles to provision a production-ready MongoDB cluster. This involves setting up MongoDB instances, configuring replication, and implementing proper security measures.

### CICD Pipeline Integration

Integrate your Ansible playbooks and roles into a CICD pipeline. This integration should automate the execution of playbooks, ensuring that your infrastructure and MongoDB cluster remain up-to-date and secure.

### Security and Best Practices

Throughout this project, prioritize security and adhere to best practices for infrastructure, application deployment, and MongoDB configuration. Ensure that your system is well-protected and follows industry standards.

## Deliverables 📦

In this challenge, you are expected to produce the following deliverables:

### 1. Architecture Diagram 🏗️
A comprehensive architecture diagram illustrates how the various cloud services and components fit together. You can use tools like draw.io, Lucidchart, or any other diagramming tool of your choice to create the diagram. 📊

### 2. Blog and GitHub Readme 📄
You should document your progress and steps taken during the challenge. This documentation could be in the form of a blog post and reference your public GitHub repo. Include code snippets, configuration files, and explanations for each step. Share your insights and learning experiences. 📝
